## üí° Concept

My project started off by creating a wireflow for my application. In my wireflow, I created something that really functions as an application. Since the assignment was to create a website that would never load a new page, this would have to be done with hiding and displaying the content that was needed to be shown at that time. I wanted a simple homescreen with an option to start scanning. Followed by a full screen barcode scanner, that shows the scanned product after a successful scan. You can see the happy flow of my application in the pictures below.
