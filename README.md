## üí° Concept

My project started off by creating a wireflow for my application. In my wireflow, I created something that really functions as an application. Since the assignment was to create a website that would never load a new page, this would have to be done with hiding and displaying the content that was needed to be shown at that time. I wanted a simple homescreen with an option to start scanning. Followed by a full screen barcode scanner, that shows the scanned product after a successful scan. You can see the happy flow of my application in the pictures below.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process (Wiki)

You can find all the progression of my work documented in my [Wiki](https://github.com/dannyfrelink/foodie-app/wiki/Progression).

## üìù Wishlist

There were a few things that I would have liked to add to my project. One of those things was my error message. When the user searches for an invalid barcode inside my error state, a error message pops up. Sadly, when the user searches for a valid one, the error message still shows for a split second. I tried for days to fix this problem and asked for help, but no one (including myself) seems to know the problem. I also would have liked to add an extra state to show when the user doesn't give permission to use their camera. Now it would just show an endless loading screen.
